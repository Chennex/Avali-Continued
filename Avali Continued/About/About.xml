The mod is an edit to the Avali mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1314474881

There are a few kinks that still need to be worked out:
Some backstories have placeholder text.
Lovin' does not currently happen.
Small meals do not seem to ever rot.

If you run into any issues besides these, please report these on the issues page of the github here: https://github.com/Chennex/Avali-Continued/issues

If you want to join in development, hit me up.
